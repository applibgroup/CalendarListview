```

## Usage
1. Declare a DayPickerView in the layout xml file
	```html	
		<com.andexert.calendarlistview.library.DayPickerView
            xmlns:ohos="http://schemas.huawei.com/res/ohos"
            ohos:id="$+id:pickerView"
            ohos:height="match_parent"
            ohos:width="match_parent"/>
	```
2. Set interface callback
    ```java
		DayPickerView dayPickerView = (DayPickerView) findComponentById(ResourceTable.Id_pickerView);
        dayPickerView.setController(new DatePickerController() {
            @Override
            public int getMaxYear() {
                // The calendar will display up to the year returned by this interface
                return 2023;
            }

            @Override
            public void onDayOfMonthSelected(int year, int month, int day) {
                // This interface is called every time the user selects a new date
                }

            @Override
            public void onDateRangeSelected(SimpleMonthAdapter.SelectedDays<SimpleMonthAdapter.CalendarDay> selectedDays) {
                // Whenever the user selects two dates, this interface will be called, and the two selected dates can be obtained
                }
        });
    ```
